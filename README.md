# Invention Factory
Invention Factory is a rigorous six week summer program at The Cooper Union in which students invent a tangible product that meets a significant need. Participants conceive of and prototype inventions, present their inventions each week to guest evaluators, file a provisional patent application and participate in a competition at which a panel of distinguished designers, inventors, engineers and patent attorneys choose the best inventions.

# EchoLight

In the summer of 2015, we invented EchoLight, a set of devices that detects and recreates sounds throughout a home, so that a person with hearing loss won’t miss a doorbell, a fire alarm, or a whistling teapot.

The three main components to our prototype are the Arduino Mega 2560, XBee Series 1, and Easy VR 3 (sound processing chip). 

By the sixth week, we had two devices that were able to communicate with each other and reproduce sound.
